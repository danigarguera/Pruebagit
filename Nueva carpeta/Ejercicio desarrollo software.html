    <h1>Cascade model</h1>
    <p>It is a sequential model where each phase of development (e.g., requirement analysis, system design,
        implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) follows the previous one. In this model the developers
        don't go back to a previous phase once completed, unless you start from scratch. <br><br>
        Some of the main characteristics of this model are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li> Rigid and linear.</li>
        <li>Requirements are fixed early. </li>
        <li>Best for well-defined projects where requirements are unlikely to change.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Iterative model</h1>
    <p>This model focuses on repetition. The development starts with a simple initial version, and more features are
        added in iterations. Each iteration results in a new version of the product that includes enhancements and
        refinements. <br><br>
        The main characteristics of this model are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Early iterations can reveal issues and provide early testing opportunities. </li>
        <li>Allows for improvements over multiple cycles.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Incremental development model</h1>
    <p>
        This model is similar to the iterative model but involves building the software incrementally. The system is
        developed in smaller, manageable pieces (increments), with each increment delivering part of the functionality.
        <br><br>
        The key characteristics of the incremental model are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The system is developed piece by piece, with each increment adding functionality.</li>
        <li>Combines elements of linear and iterative models.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h1>Spiral model</h1>
    <p>
        The spiral model combines elements of iterative development and systematic risk analysis. Each phase in the
        development process is preceded by a risk analysis step, ensuring that potential risks are identified and
        addressed early. <br><br>
        Some of the main characteristics of the spiral model are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The development is broken down into multiple phases, with risk analysis being central to each phase.</li>
        <li>It allows for changes and revisions based on risk findings.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h1>Prototype model</h1>
    <p>The prototype model Involves building a prototype or working model of the software early in the development cycle
        to gather feedback from users. This prototype is typically a simplified version that helps clarify requirements.
        <br><br>
        Their main characteristics are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Focuses on creating early versions of the software (prototypes) to visualize the final product.</li>
        <li>The prototypes may be discarded after requirements are finalized, but feedback guides the final system.</li>
    </ul>
